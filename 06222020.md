# Problem

There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume **nums1** and **nums2** cannot be both empty.

> Example1:
>
> nums1 = [1, 3]
>
> nums2 = [2]
>
>  The median is 2.0
>
> 
>
> Example2:
>
> nums1 = [1, 2]
>
> nums2 = [3, 4]
>
> The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

- Median:
  - for total number is even arrays, median is the average of the middle two numbers
  - for total number is odd arrays, median is the middle element
- Partition both arrays (A (length is m), B (length is n)) into left part and right part, s.t.
  - \# of left part of A + # of left part of B = # of right part of A + # of right part of B
  - all elements in the left part < all elements in the right part
  - Condition (A is the array with shorter length) (partitionA + partitionB = (m+n+1)/2):
    - Found: maxLeftA <= minRightB && maxLeftB <= minRightA
    - else if: maxLeftA > minRightB then move towards left in A
    - else: move towards right in A
  - Summary: Binary search in the array with shorter length

```python
def median(A, B):
    m, n = len(A), len(B)
    if m > n:
        A, B, m, n = B, A, n, m

    imin, imax, half_len = 0, m, (m + n + 1) // 2
    while imin <= imax:
        i = (imin + imax) // 2
        j = half_len - i
        if i < m and B[j - 1] > A[i]:
            # i is too small, must increase it
            imin = i + 1
        elif i > 0 and A[i - 1] > B[j]:
            # i is too big, must decrease it
            imax = i - 1
        else:
            # i is perfect
            if i == 0:
                # All elements in A is larger than elements in B
                # therefore, left part consists solely elements in B
                max_of_left = B[j - 1]
            elif j == 0:
                max_of_left = A[i - 1]
            else:
                max_of_left = max(A[i - 1], B[j - 1])

            if (m + n) % 2 == 1:
                return max_of_left

            if i == m:
                # All elements in A is smaller than elements in B
                # therefore, left part consists solely elements in A
                min_of_right = B[j]
            elif j == n:
                min_of_right = A[i]
            else:
                min_of_right = min(A[i], B[j])

            return (max_of_left + min_of_right) / 2.0

# testcase
print(median([1,3], [2]))
print(median([1,2], [3,4]))
```
